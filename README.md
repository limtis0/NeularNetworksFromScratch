# Neural Networks From Scratch

Following [a book](https://nnfs.io/) and [the YouTube-series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3)
on Neural Networks from Scratch by [Sentdex's](https://www.youtube.com/@sentdex)

I am taking this course to fill the blank spaces in my knowledge of Machine Learning 
and to get a better in-depth understanding of it as well.
